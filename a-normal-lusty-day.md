# A Normal Lusty Day

* Sh(I) was giving online Test for his upcoming examinations. Suddenly he started thinking about a girl.
* gone to do toilet near the bathroom
* I found birds chirping , enjoyed nature, distracted from lusty mind, peeing and enjoying natur and sounds
* mind with high dopamine level addicted to high dopamine activities







While Sh means I was deeply engrossed in an online test in preparation for his important examinations, his focus was abruptly disrupted by thoughts of a girl. This sudden mental diversion led him to take a break and walk to the toilet located near the bathroom.

Upon stepping outside, he was greeted by the cheerful chirping of birds. This encounter with nature served as a pleasant distraction from his earlier lustful thoughts. As he stood there, relieving himself, he found himself immersed in the serenity of nature, fully savoring the sounds and tranquility that surrounded him.

During this moment of respite, it became clear that his mind, usually seeking activities associated with high dopamine levels, was momentarily satisfied by the simple, yet profound pleasures nature provided. The usual penchant for stimuli that sparked dopamine release was, at least for the time being, replaced by the calming and unadulterated joy of connecting with the natural world.

As Sh resumed his walk back inside, the juxtaposition between the high-stress environment of examinations and the tranquil outdoors was stark. The simplicity of nature, often overlooked in his daily pursuit of achievement, had offered him a brief sanctuary—a stark reminder of the world beyond screens and deadlines.

The experience led to a moment of introspection about his lifestyle choices. The constant chase for high dopamine-inducing activities—from intense gaming sessions to the relentless scrolling through social media—had taken a toll on his ability to appreciate the quieter moments life offered.

#### Persistent Sexual Preoccupation

Despite engaging in daily activities, I found my thoughts constantly drawn toward sexual fantasies, a fixation that interrupted even my most focused moments. The relentless arousal seemed beyond my control, indicating a possible addiction to these thoughts.

Escapist Phantasms. I indulged in vivid daydreams where I possessed the power to conjure sexual partners at will, utilising an imaginary magical entity to fulfill my desires. These fantasies extended to transforming the mundane into the exotic, granting me limitless opportunities for intimacy. Yet, I was acutely aware that these were just figments of my imagination, leaving me confronting the reality of my inexperience.

#### Addressing the Fanciful Mind

The dichotomy between fantasy and reality serves as a poignant reminder of my inner desires and the introspective journey I must undertake to align them with the tangible world.

**Obsession with Thoughts of Intimacy**

* Constantly thinking about a girl and feeling aroused
* Difficulty focusing on studies due to persistent sexual thoughts

**Imaginary Scenarios**

* Daydreaming about having magical powers to satisfy desires
* Fantasizing about transforming creatures into beings to fulfill lustful urges
* Acknowledging these thoughts were mere fantasies and not reality

> _It's important to recognize that such thoughts are natural, but they shouldn't overpower our ability to live in the present and focus on our goals._
