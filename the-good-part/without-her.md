Title: The Enchanted Voyage

My body was tethering; I was more than nervous, and time was slipping away. It was the first time I was without her, and after I found her, things didn't feel quite right. I found myself on a bus, surrounded by the chatter of my friends, but my mind was elsewhere, tethered to the thoughts of her – her voice, her eyes, her hair, her lips, her face – everything.

I was on a trip with my friends, but she couldn't join me. It was her meeting with her world, her people, and she had to go; it wasn't optional. She wanted to be with me, and I could feel her absence like a void in my heart.

As the bus rumbled on, memories of her flooded my mind. I closed my eyes, trying to picture her in my thoughts. The way her laughter echoed in my ears, the warmth of her gaze, the strands of her hair dancing in the wind, the softness of her lips – every detail etched in my mind.

The ache of missing her intensified with every passing mile. I tried to distract myself with the excitement of the school trip, the new adventures awaiting us, but her absence overshadowed everything. I longed for her presence beside me.

Suddenly, tears welled up in my eyes, uninvited and uncontrollable. The realization hit me – it was just a few days without her, and I couldn't bear it. In a moment of overwhelming emotion, I shouted, startling everyone on the bus. Their curious gazes turned towards me, but I was beyond feeling embarrassed. This was not just a trivial matter; it was an ache deep within my soul.

I wiped away the tears, trying to compose myself. The bus journey continued, and I stared out of the window, lost in my thoughts. Little did my friends know that the reason for my distress was not something ordinary. She wasn't just any girl – she was a magical being I had discovered in the form of a parrot.

We had shared a unique connection, a bond that transcended the ordinary. Her magical nature added an enchanting layer to our relationship, making her absence even harder to bear. As the bus carried me to a different school for the trip, I couldn't help but wonder if there was a way to bridge the gap between our worlds and bring her back to my side.
